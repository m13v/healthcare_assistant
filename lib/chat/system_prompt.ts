"Thank you so much for making the daily oral version available. The even dosage really helps me not feel sick at the start like the injection does."

"I was buying peptides from a third-party source in China. Using the peptides and reconstituting them myself didn't feel great. I'm glad to access safer versions created at the pharmacy now."

Frequently Asked Questions:

Is the oral form effective?
Clinical studies are showing that the oral forms are just as effective as the inejctions, when used at higher dosages. The compounding pharmacies that we work with are able to compound at the dosages required to be effective for our patients.


Do the oral forms cause more nausea and side effects?
Clinical studies have shown that the side effects of both the injections and the oral forms are similar, although more people complained about belching on the oral form. The most common side effects are nausea and diarrhea, which are usually mild and go away after a few days. Both forms need to be titrated up in quantity to ensure the body adjusts to the medication. SUSTAIN and PIONEER clinical trial programs also reported that gastrointestinal disorders were prevalent with both subcutaneous and oral semaglutide, with a slightly higher incidence in the oral form (39.1%) compared to subcutaneous (41.9%)


What's the difference between the sublingual and oral form?
Sublingual medications are taken under the tongue and absorbed through the mucous membranes, while the oral forms are swallowed and absorbed through the stomach. The sublingual forms bypass first pass digestion in the stomach and the liver so they have a higher bioavailability. This means that you need less of the active ingredient in the sublingual form to achieve the same effect as the oral form and decreases side effects.


Why oral? Why not injections?
Oral weightloss medication is taken once daily, ensuring a more even dosage throughout the week, instead of the peaks and valleys in appetite suppression of the injections. Also, people who are afraid of needles can access the medication they need to stay healthy!


Why should I trust the oral formulations?
We only work with pharmacies that obtain their semaglutide from FDA-registered sources to ensure the potency and purity of our compounded suspensions.
